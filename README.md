##### Here is the early image of the LAMP when i opened it, i simply got to know that a wire was removed from its place(the wire connected to the 4v battery).
 
##### I soldered the wire and connected the lamp to the supply but unfortunately i heard a loud  voice through which i could 
##### recognise that the capacitor has blown. I opened it again and found the same that i guessed and with capacitor a diode was also blown.
                                       

#### I bought a new capacitor with bit high voltage compare to which was in it before(63v,100uf- new)  and a diode(1N4007). Soldered it in the PCB.

#### Finally when i connected it to the supply it was perfectly glowing.
